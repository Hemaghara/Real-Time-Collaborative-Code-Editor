The provided code implements a Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor that allows users to
write HTML code in a text area and immediately see the output rendered in an iframe. Here's a 
breakdown:

Key Features:

1]HTML Input:
 The <textarea> element (id="src") is where users type their HTML code.

2]Real-Time Preview:
The <iframe> (id="view-result") displays the rendered output of the HTML code entered in the text area.

3]Dynamic Rendering:
A JavaScript function (show()) listens for input events (oninput) in the text area.
It retrieves the content of the text area (src) and updates the iframe's srcdoc property to render the typed HTML instantly.

Components:
1]HTML Structure:
Contains a <div> with two main elements: the textarea for code input and the iframe for displaying the result.

2]CSS (style.css):
Expected to style the editor layout (e.g., positioning and responsiveness).

3]JavaScript (script.js):
Contains the show() function to handle the real-time update functionality.


Functionality:
When the user types HTML code into the text area, the oninput event triggers the show() function. 
This function dynamically updates the srcdoc attribute of the iframe with the entered HTML, providing
an immediate visual preview of the code's output.

This setup is ideal for beginners to practice and see their HTML changes in real-time.
